Don't be surprised if I follow you randomly. You just seemed like a cool person. ðŸ˜„ i don't have specific friend group i'm just sort of chill with whoever as long as you're not a total prick to me. that being said, I'll BLOCK FREELY (if i do, prob because i was upset/uncomfortable. other than that i don't really do that)

!formally known as @/DaPurpleDog. I wanted to change users for a while ^^.) I have a lot of names, but new ppl can call me smudge!

black, panromantic-demisexual demigirl (useless. i know)

multifandom artist/animator writer, and a wannabe comic and music artist. 

I AM not much of a talker. but a little chat is always nice
