C+H is always welcome, even when I'm afk.
I also have a somewhat bad grammer, so- pfft
if i dont ever respond in public, you can always whisper/dm. i will see it- eventually-

Don't be surprised if I follow you randomly. You just seemed like a cool person. ðŸ˜„ i don't have specific friend group i'm just sort of chill with whoever as long as you're not a total prick to me. that being said, I'll BLOCK FREELY (if i do, prob because i was upset/uncomfortable. other than that i don't really do that)
!formally known as @/DaPurpleDog. I wanted to change users for a while ^^.) I have a lot of names, but new ppl can call me smudge! 

I'm a teen, furry, griffin otherkin and HollyLeaf(and more )fictionkin. a chaotic bunch....(rabid idiot/hj),
multifandom artist/animatoraccount) writer, and a wannabe comic and music artist. 
not much of a talker. 
my art style keeps evolving/changing TwT. I'm also known for um- my constant zoomorphism of media characters *sweats*. and yuh dni weird people if YK what I mean. i can be out of context sometimes XD |

i might fix this eventually. i copied things from
my pateron and pixilart thingyy as sort of a placeholder 
cus i kinda wanna remove 
that link for something else but idk what 
it would be

 ever wake up one day only to realize you've been transformed into markeable plushies...
